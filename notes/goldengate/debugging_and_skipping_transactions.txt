# Debugging and Skipping Transactions

To debug a 'MAPPING FAILED' error. The log show something like the following:

2014-08-13 06:14:19  WARNING OGG-01431  Aborted grouped transaction on 'CFG.ACCESS_', Mapping error.
2014-08-13 06:14:19  WARNING OGG-01003  Repositioning to rba 33263845 in seqno 46.
2014-08-13 06:14:19  WARNING OGG-01151  Error mapping from CFG.ACCESS_ to CFG.ACCESS_.
2014-08-13 06:14:19  WARNING OGG-01003  Repositioning to rba 33263845 in seqno 46.

You will probably also see something in the log that shows which trail file is in use. If this message is not in the logs, then you can figure out which trail file by looking in the trail file directory for sequence 46.

./dirdat/remote/CFGDB1EQ/CFG/c1000046

To figure out what is going on, you need to use the logdump utility

Open logdump:

$ ./logdump
logdump> open ./dirdat/remote/CFGDB1EQ/CFG/c1000046
logdump> GHDR ON
logdump> DETAIL ON
logdump> DETAIL DATA

# Reposition to just before the error
logdump> pos 33263840

# Scan for a transaction header
logdump> SCANFORHEADER

This will produce something that looks like:

Hdr-Ind    :     E  (x45)     Partition  :     .  (x04)
UndoFlag   :     .  (x00)     BeforeAfter:     B  (x42)

Notice the highlighted line - it has the RBA of our error, and also that it is a delete statement.

In the header, note the TransInd is x00 - that indicates this is the first statement in a new transaction. 

x00 - First statement in a transaction
x01 - Statement in the middle of the transaction
x02 - Last statement in a transaction
x03 - Sole statement in transaction

At this point you are looking at the first statment in the transaction - by using the 'N' command, you can move to the next statement in the transaction - if there are a lot of them, you may want to jump to the last statement in the transaction with the SCANFORENDTRANS (or SFET) command.



Pressing N one last time moves you into the next transaction - note the RBA - (33341743 in this case)

Now, you need to tell the replicat process to start at the next good transaction:

ggsci> alter RQPRCFG, extseqno 46, extrba 33579410
ggsci> start RQPRCFG


Obviously doing this means the transaction you skipped will not be applied to the database, so if this is a production system you could be in trouble.
