Generally Archiver error is caused by full recovery_file dest:

select  name,  (space_limit/1048576),(space_used/1048576)
from  v$recovery_file_dest;


The easiest quick fix is to bump the size of the recovery_file_dest:

alter system set db_recovery_file_dest_size=20G scope=both;

However, it maybe useful to remove archive_log_files using rman if it is a dev environment.
