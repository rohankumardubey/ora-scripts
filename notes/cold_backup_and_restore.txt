# Backup

To take a cold backup of the database:

    rman target /

    shutdown immediate 
    startup mount 
    run 
    { allocate channel ch1 device type disk format 'c:\alaric_db_backup\alaricDB_%u_%p_%c';   
      backup as compressed backupset incremental level 0 tag="Alaric_fullDB" database; 
    } 
    list backup tag="Alaric_fullDB";

From the log output, you need to capture two pieces of information:

    connected to target database: XE (DBID= *2671809425*)   <==== Save this ID number

Identify the backup piece that contains the SP and Control files, eg:

    BS Key  Type LV Size       Device Type Elapsed Time Completion Time
    ------- ---- -- ---------- ----------- ------------ ---------------
    2       Incr 0  1.03M      DISK        00:00:01     07-AUG-12
            BP Key: 2   Status: AVAILABLE  Compressed: YES  Tag: ALARIC_FULLDB
            Piece Name: C:\ALARIC_DB_BACKUP\ALARICDB_02NI201U_1_1         <====== PIECE NAME
      Control File Included: Ckp SCN: 218491       Ckp time: 07-AUG-12    <====== control file
      SPFILE Included: Modification time: 07-AUG-12                       <====== SPFILE included


# Restore

Notice the DBID and SPFILE and Control File reference the data that was captured above.

    set ORACLE_SID=xe 
    rman target /

    set dbid 2671809425
    startup nomount
    restore spfile from 'C:\ALARIC_DB_BACKUP\ALARICDB_02NI201U_1_1';
    startup force nomount
    restore controlfile from 'C:\ALARIC_DB_BACKUP\ALARICDB_02NI201U_1_1';
    alter database mount;
    restore database;
    alter database open resetlogs;
